Docker Cloud provides a hosted registry service with build and testing facilities for Dockerlized application images;
    tools to help you set up and manage host infrastructure; and application lifecycle features to automate deploying
    and redeploying services created from images.

iDocker Cloud uses the hosted Docker Cloud Registry, which allows you to publish Dockerized images on the internet either
    publicly or privately. Docker Cloud could also store pre-built images, or link to your source code so it can build the
    code into Docker images, and optionally test the resulting images before publishing.

Registry service contains repositories.
